# DesignCrowd Assignment

Written by James Dang

## Solution Location

You can find the file at *Business Days/Program.cs*. This is personally my first time initalising a repository with C# so I apologise if the repo has too much unecessary boilerplate code.

## Notes

All tasks were completed. 

However, my solution to Task 3 only handles holidays that recur on a specific day for a specific month (e.g Queen's Birthday). It will not handle holidays like Easter, who's date is determined by the Moon.

In my solution, you will also find the expected results of all Tasks in the main function. :)
